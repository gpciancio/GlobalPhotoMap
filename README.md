Global Photo Map

The purpose of creating this app is to solve the problem of people limiting exposure to beautiful pictures outside their social media groups.

Every day millions of people from all over the world look at pictures on various digital platforms, but most of the time they limit their views to pictures shared by friends and family and hardly ever strangers.

Photo Map will bridge the gap by connecting people to people all over the world with the same affinity to sharing and viewing pictures, but now they will not be limited.  Photo Map will allow awesome visualizations of photos from around the world without being constricted to viewing photos in one's network.  Users may tag a place on the map and open their eyes to the uncharted exploration of photos in a world community.  

The cool part of Photo Map is that all you need to do is click on the map and it will return awesome photos for you to view save and share.

Photo Map works because it leverages Google Maps and Flickr API's and powered by JavaScript, JSON, AJAX, JQERY, CSS/Materialize and HTML to visualize photos from around the globe.

Photo Map is built with basic features that will be built up with the ability to share photos to social media outlets, email/MMS and download.  Also, uploading of your own photos will be capable by logging into your Flickr through embedded links.

Enjoy the show!
